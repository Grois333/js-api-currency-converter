The program will take in currency code we want to convert
from and currency code we want to convert to,
as well as the amount of money.
Afterwards, the program will output the correct exchange rate
based on the data from the APIs.
In this application we’re going receive data from two asynchronous sources:
Currency Layer — https://currencylayer.com —
You’ll need to sign up for free so you can use the API Access Key.
This API will provide us with data needed to calculate exchange rate
between currencies.
Rest Countries — http://restcountries.eu/ —
This API will give us information about where can we use the currency
we just converted our money to.
